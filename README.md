Math Calculator that is written purely on C#
/////////////////////////////////////////////

BTW this is all the source code as the real thing has extra directories like

CalculatorFIles/

Calculator.sh

ALl above are more higher files in the directory and is because of easy look at the code.

## To Satisfy my Coding OCD i added the programming languages i used:

C#

Shell

Batchfile

Markdown (Technically not but it counts i guess.)

(Not my making, pre-generated by system)

XML

JSON
