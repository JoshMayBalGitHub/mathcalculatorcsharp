# Math Calculator in C#
Math Calculator that is written purely on (Mostly) C#


/////////////////////////////////////////////

BTW this is all the source code as the real thing has extra directories like

CalculatorFIles/

Calculator.sh

ALl above are more higher files in the directory and is because of easy look at the code.

## To Satisfy my Coding Brain i added the programming languages i used:

C#

Shell

Batchfile

Markdown (Technically not but it counts i guess.)

*(Below is not my making, pre-generated by system)*

XML

JSON

Now i wrote the calculator itself with c# but to make it work i had to use a few other languages like shell and batchfile.
